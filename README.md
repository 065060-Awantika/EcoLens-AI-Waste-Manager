# ♻️ EcoLens: AI-Powered Sustainability Audit Tool

### *Bridging Deep Learning & Circular Economy Strategy*

**EcoLens** is an intelligent waste segregation and auditing system designed to optimize municipal and corporate recycling operations. By leveraging **Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2)**, this tool automates the classification of waste into six distinct categories, providing real-time operational insights and economic recovery value analysis.

## 🚀 Business Value & Application

This project serves as a proof-of-concept for **Smart City Infrastructure** and **ESG Compliance** automation.

* **📉 Operational Efficiency:** Reduces manual sorting time and errors in Material Recovery Facilities (MRFs).
* **💰 Economic Recovery:** Instantly identifies high-value recyclables (e.g., Metal, Cardboard) vs. cost-incurring waste.
* **🌍 ESG Reporting:** Automates data collection for Carbon Footprint and Sustainability Audit reports.

## 🧠 Technical Architecture

* **Model:** MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning) tailored for resource-constrained environments.
* **Dataset:** [TrashNet](https://github.com/garythung/trashnet) (2,500+ images across 6 classes).
* **Accuracy:** Optimized for real-world variances (lighting, rotation, background).
* **Interface:** Streamlit (Python) for rapid deployment and user interaction.

### Classification Categories:
1.  **Cardboard** (High-Value Fiber)
2.  **Glass** (Infinitely Recyclable)
3.  **Metal** (High-Value Scrap)
4.  **Paper** (Mixed Fiber)
5.  **Plastic** (Petroleum-based Polymer)
6.  **Trash** (Landfill/Incineration)
